    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This model solves a minimum-cost flight itinerary optimization problem using linear programming. It selects a path from a source city to a destination city by chaining together valid flights while minimizing the total fare. The model ensures logical routing with flow conservation constraints and supports multiple intermediate connections.\n",

    "## Data source\n",
    "A copy of the [Airelines Flights Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/airlines-flights-data/data) provided in the Kaggle repository was saved in this project's folder locally. The dataset contained inside a csv file which includes the following attributes/columns described by the Author:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  Airline: The name of the airline company is stored in the airline column. It is a categorical feature having 6 different airlines.\n",
    "2)\tFlight: Stores information regarding the planeâ€™s flight code. It is a categorical feature.\n",
    "3)\tSource City: City from which the flight takes off. It is a categorical feature having 6 unique cities.\n",
    "4)\tDeparture Time: This is a derived categorical feature obtained created by grouping time periods into bins. It stores information about the departure time and have 6 unique time labels.\n",
    "5)\tStops: A categorical feature with 3 distinct values that stores the number of stops between the source and destination cities.\n",
    "6)\tArrival Time: This is a derived categorical feature created by grouping time intervals into bins. It has six distinct time labels and keeps information about the arrival time.\n",
    "7)\tDestination City: City where the flight will land. It is a categorical feature having 6 unique cities.\n",
    "8)\tClass: A categorical feature that contains information on seat class; it has two distinct values: Business and Economy.\n",
    "9)\tDuration: A continuous feature that displays the overall amount of time it takes to travel between cities in hours.\n",
    "10)\tDays Left: This is a derived characteristic that is calculated by substracting the trip date from the booking date.\n",
    "11)\tPrice: Target variable stores information of the ticket price."
