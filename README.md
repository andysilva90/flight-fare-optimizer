# flight-fare-optimizer
Optimizing multi-leg flight itineraries with OR and data science.

This model solves a minimum-cost flight itinerary optimization problem using linear programming. It selects a path from a source city to a destination city by chaining together valid flights while minimizing the total fare. The model ensures logical routing with flow conservation constraints and supports multiple intermediate connections.
